# Start using this project

- Start by `npm i`.

- Open a `testrpc` by hitting `testrpc` in the terminal. (or) simply open `Ganache`.

- In this dir, `truffle.cmd compile` (Compile contracts, and generate **Build** folder containing `.json` files)

- Then `truffle.cmd migrate` (Deploy in the active network).

- `npm run dev`.

**You are up and running now.**

# Some points to remember

- Look out for `ports`.

- Remember to use `truffle.cmd` nearly everywhere.

- Remove `Showroom.sol` and write your own `.sol` file.

- Change `index.html` according to your design.

- Configure `app.js` according to your needs.

- Now `truffle compile` then `truffle migrate`.

- Using `Ganache` as a `testrpc` running in private test net - `localhost:8545`.

    
> In case of some error in `metamask` or any sort of transaction, `enable / disable` the extension first before changing the code.
